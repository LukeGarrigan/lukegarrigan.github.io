# Free Planning Poker 
Got annoyed with planning-poker app's popups/paywalls interfering with planning meetings, so decide to create my own. If you're interested in how the app was created I wrote a blog about it on [codeheir.com](https://codeheir.com), that can be found [here](https://codeheir.com/2021/02/27/coding-a-planning-poker-app/)

It is currently running at Go to [lukegarrigan.github.io](lukegarrigan.github.io)
